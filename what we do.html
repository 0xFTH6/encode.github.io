<p>ㅤㅤUsing a SSL/TLS protocols ensures that data transmitted between the customer and the server is encrypted,</p>
<p>ㅤㅤmaking it difficult for malicious actors to intercept sensitive information. Additionally, employing tokenization</p>
<p>ㅤㅤcan further secure payment details by replacing sensitive data with unique identification symbols that retain all the</p>
<p>ㅤㅤessential information about the data without compromising its security. Moreover, implementing multi-factor authentication</p>
<p>ㅤㅤ(MFA) adds an extra layer of protection by requiring users to verify their identity through multiple means, such as a password</p>
<p>ㅤㅤand a temporary code sent to their mobile device. Regularly updating and patching software to fix vulnerabilities, conducting security</p>
<p>ㅤㅤaudits, and adhering to compliance standards like PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) are also crucial steps in ensuring</p> 
<p>ㅤㅤa secure payment process. By combining these methods, businesses can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and build trust with their customers.</p>
